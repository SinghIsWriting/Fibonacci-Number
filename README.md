# Fibonacci Number Calculator

This repository contains a C program that calculates the Fibonacci number of a given input using both recursive and iterative approaches.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. For example, you can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on Linux or MinGW on Windows.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/SinghIsWriting/Fibonacci-Number.git

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
3. Compile the C program using your preferred C compiler. For example, with GCC:
gcc fibonacci_number.c -o fibonacci

4. Run the compiled program:
./fibonacci

5. The program will prompt you to enter a positive integer number.

6. Enter the number for which you want to calculate the Fibonacci number.

7. The program will calculate and display the Fibonacci number using both the recursive and iterative approaches.

## Program Details

The `fibonacci_number.c` file contains a program that calculates the Fibonacci number of a given input using both recursive and iterative approaches.

The user is prompted to enter a positive integer number. The program then calculates the Fibonacci number using both the recursive and iterative approaches.

The recursive approach uses a function that calls itself to calculate the Fibonacci number. It has exponential time complexity, which may result in slower execution for large inputs.

The iterative approach uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci number iteratively. It has linear time complexity and is more efficient for larger inputs.

The program displays the Fibonacci number calculated using both approaches for comparison purposes.

Feel free to explore the code in the repository and modify it according to your needs.

Happy coding!
